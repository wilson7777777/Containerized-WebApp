Containerized-WebApp: [PROJECT PURPOSE - e.g., Simple Task Manager]
This repository contains a modern, full-stack web application built with a multi-tier architecture and containerized using Docker Compose. It demonstrates best practices for separation of concerns and scalable deployment.

üöÄ Key Technologies
This application is composed of five distinct, containerized services:

Component

Technology

Key Details

Backend API

Python (Flask)

A RESTful API built with Flask, managing business logic and connecting to the database and cache.

Database

PostgreSQL

A reliable relational database, configured to initialize schema and data using database/init.sql.

Cache/Broker

Redis

Used by the API for high-speed caching or message queuing.

Frontend

Node.js/React (or similar)

The client-side application, built using a Node.js ecosystem (as indicated by package.json and src/).

Reverse Proxy

Nginx

The single entry point, routing requests to either the frontend or the api container.

Orchestration

Docker & Docker Compose

Used to define, build, and run the entire multi-container application stack with a single command.

üíª Architecture Overview
The application utilizes a five-container microservice pattern, all orchestrated by docker-compose.yml:

frontend: The user interface is served by Nginx.

api: The Python/Flask backend depends on and connects to the db and redis services.

db: The PostgreSQL database.

redis: The Redis cache/broker.

nginx: Sits at the edge, exposing port 80 to the internet and managing traffic flow to the internal services.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Getting Started
Prerequisites
You must have the following software installed:

Docker

Docker Compose (Often bundled with Docker Desktop)

Installation and Run
Clone the Repository:

git clone [https://github.com/wilson7777777/Containerized-WebApp.git](https://github.com/wilson7777777/Containerized-WebApp.git)
cd Containerized-WebApp

Build and Start the Application:
Use Docker Compose to build the required images and start all five services in detached mode (-d). This step may take a few minutes for initial image building.

docker-compose up --build -d

Access the Application:
The application will be accessible via your browser once the services are running:

http://localhost:80
Stopping and Cleanup
To stop and remove all running containers, associated networks, and temporary volumes:

docker-compose down

‚öôÔ∏è Configuration & Environment Variables
The application manages sensitive data and inter-service communication through environment variables defined in docker-compose.yml.

Service

Variable

Value

Purpose

db

POSTGRES_PASSWORD

postgres

Sets the superuser password for the PostgreSQL database.

api

DB_HOST

db

Specifies the internal Docker network name of the database service.

api

DB_PASSWORD

postgres

Passes the required password for the API to connect to the database.

api

REDIS_HOST

redis

Specifies the internal Docker network name of the Redis service.

Docker Compose (docker-compose.yml)

    depends_on:
      - api
    ports:
      - "3000:3000" # Frontend serves on port 3000 internally
  nginx:
    image: nginx:alpine
    ports:
      - "80:80" # Exposed externally
    volumes:
      - ./nginx/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
    depends_on:
      - api
